# ETCH-A-SKETCH

ETCH-A-SKETC is one of the taskts given on the [Odin Project course](https://www.theodinproject.com/home). The main point of the task was to exercise Javascript skills. Etch-a-skets is a sketchpad-like page runned on the browser. It should allow a user to pain using the mouse. Full information can be found on [this link](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).
